# Meli-android-Challenge

The objective of this app is to use the Market APIs
Free, allowing a user to see the details of a product.
To achieve this, Mercado Libre has APIs open to the community so that any
developer consumes them and can have searches and purchases in their application.
The app should have three screens:
1. Search Screen.
2. Search results (Products list).
3. Product detail.


Search Screen:
